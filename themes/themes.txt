                           HEXO AUTHORING THEME FOLDERS
                           ----------------------------

    Hexo allows any number of theme folders to be added to the hexo-authoring
    folders for a given blog.  The particular theme applied in generating the
    blog is specified in the hexo-level _config.yml file.

    For hexo-spanner, this file and folder is part of the orcmid/hexo-spanner
    repository.  Individual-theme subfolders are excluded, each having their
    own source-code repository, even for the landscape theme installed as part
    of hexojs/hexo

MANIFEST

       themes.txt This manifest and description file for the themes folder
                  of the hexo-spanner source files for the hexo-authored
                  Spanner Wingnut blog.  This file is managed under the
                  hexo-spanner GitHub repository.

    landscape/    The files of hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape customized as the
                  landscape theme for the hexo-authored Spanner Wingnut blog.
                  This folder and files are source-managed separate from the
                  orcmid/hexo-spanner repository.  Instead this customized
                  theme is managed at orcmid/hexo-theme-landscape-wingnut and
                  is not a fork of hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape.

TODO:

 * Add license statement for this file and ensure consistency with the
   licensing and notices at the orcmid/hexo-spanner level.

 * If I am not using VSS any longer, remove the archive cases.  Reflect this
   consideration at other levels.

 * Download and install ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus and unzip under here,
   then customize for Spanner Wingnut.
