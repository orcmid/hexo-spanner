               DOCUMENT ENGINEERING OF THE LANDSCAPE HEXO THEME
               ------------------------------------------------
                                 
    The hexo-about/hexo-landsacpe/ subfolder is provided for preservation of
    information on the customization and maintenance of the landscape theme
    within the authoring folder used for Hexo generation of the current Spanner
    Wingnut blog posts and supporting pages.  
    
    Over time thee can be other Hexo themes installed under the same authoring
    configuration.  The landscape theme is provide automatically with a fresh
    installation of the Hexo configuration in an authoring folder.
    
    Preservation here is for two purposes:
    
      * Re-creation of landscape theme customizations in the event that the
        authoring folder and/or theme are re-installed as part of an update or
        for any other reason.
        
      * Guidance of the customization of additional Hexo-installed authoring
        folders for blogs added or restored using the same basic approach
        and the landscape theme (at least initially).
