    This file is maintained at nfoCentrale/spanner/spanner.txt on the author's
    PC for authoring of the wingnut blog using node.js and Hexo.  The latest
    (shared mirror) copy in spanner/source/about/ is automatically included 
    when the static blog pages generated by Hexo in nfoCentrale/wingnut/public/
    are uploaded to <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut>.
    
    This text file documents the spanner/ Hexo configuration and further
    customizations performed as part of development of the authoring folder and
    the use of node.js and Hexo.  All authoring activity is performed on the 
    Windows 10 desktop PC of the author.

TODO:
 
  * I will want MaxJax working so that LaTex formulas can be included.
  
  * Change the highlighting of code blocks to operate on a light background.
  
  * Have a simple Archive format instead of the 2D grid of snippets.
  
  * Get the correct atom feed location.  It should be relative to the blog
    "root" and not orcmid.com/.  Enable feed production.
      
  * Remove the blog search button and related material.  Figure out how this
    involves the theme also.  Probably start unhooking there first.
  
  * Fix the footer to provide licensing of the blog content.
  
  * Fix the footer to acknowledge Powered by Hexo and the theme origin.
  
  * Find out how to fix the Hamburger on the mobile presentation.
  
  * On the Archives page, provide a link to older archives.  The Archives 
    index on every page might have that item, as shown on blogger.  I might
    be able to use the same widget.  I can have a post that about legacy
    archives either way.
     
  * Enable categories and tags.
  
  * Inhibit any tag cloud.
