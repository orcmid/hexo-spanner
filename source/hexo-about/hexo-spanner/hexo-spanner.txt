              DOCUMENT ENGINEERING OF THE HEXO-GENERATED AUTHORING
              ----------------------------------------------------

    The hexo-about/hexo-spanner/ subfolder is provided for preservation of
    information on the customization and maintenance of the authoring folder
    used for Hexo generation of the current Spanner Wingnut blog posts and
    supporting pages.
    
    Preservation here is for two purposes:
    
      * Re-creation of the authoring customizations in the event that the
        authoring folder is re-installed as part of a Hexo update or for
        any other reason.
        
      * Guidance of the customization of additional Hexo-installed authoring
        folders for blogs added or restored using the same basic approach
        and stylings.
        
    Note: This and additional material is also preserved in the Visual Source
    Safe $/HexoSpanner project repository on a separate local PC.  Preservation
    here provides off-site preservation and a public account of the hosted-site
    document engineering.  
    
    
RELATED INFORMATION

  * Themes can be changed over time, and different blog customizations may
    involve alternative themes.  Locate individual theme-specific sub-folders
    via <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/hexo-about/>.

TODO:
 
 * Add explanation of this supporting material to the index.md/.html page.
 
 * Link to tips or other resources, unless handled in index.md.
 
 * The preservation of customization material via copies under the blog-
   -authoring source/ folder is impeded by Hexo generating from some of
   the file texts meant to be preserved as-is.  An alternative approach
   is desired.
   
 * It needs to be clear why git and GitHub don't work for this because of
   the way hexo-cli and Hexo themes are distributed and updated by git
   cloning.  We need to avoid collision with local customizations and
   updates from the original sources.
