Laboratory for experimental modification of web application features and functions before incorporating into anything serious. Disorganized and unkempt, just like the poor lad himself.

### History ###

 * 0.4.2 2017-11-29-16:18 The Hexo-generated wingnut is "live" with image support, customizations, and proper synchronization of only new/changed material on publishing updates.

 * 0.4.1 2017-10-29-10:06 As the first customization step, this "about" page is created in demonstration of how non-post pages are added to the site and determine what is needed to hook the page into the new Hexo-generated blog.  The page is produced in a folder, using the Hexo asset-page model.  The blog template does not integrate it without further customization.
 
 * 0.4.0 2017-10-25-17:57 First experimental post using  [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)-generated pages to an [exploratory location](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/index.html) that  sits side-by-side with the previous blog posts, archives, and feeds.  Initial effort is narrated on [Orcmid's Live Hideout](https://orcmid.wordpress.com) under tag [Hexo](https://orcmid.wordpress.com/tag/hexo/).
 
 * 0.3.0 2010-10-02-19:11 Last Post using Movable Type, with a  proposed progression that was not pursued, [Next Steps in the Laboratory](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/2010/10/next-steps-in-the-laboratory.htm).
 
 * 0.2.0 2010-05-23-13:26 Initial Post using Movable Type 4, attempting self-host generation and static pages for the  nfoCentrale blogs, [Moving to Movable Type](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/2010/05/moving-to-movable-type.htm).
 
 * 0.1.0 2010-05-01-01:39 Final post using Blogger, reporting on how all of the nfoCentrale Blogger-produced blogs are placed on hiatus, [What, No Parachutes?](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/default.blogger.htm).  This was precipitated by Blogger withdrawing the FTP publishing option.
 
 * 0.0.0 2004-06-17-21:45 Inauguration as a Blogger-generated blog  with pages published to orcmid.com via the Blogger FTP publishing option.  The first post is at  [Inauguration](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/2004/06/inauguration.asp).
