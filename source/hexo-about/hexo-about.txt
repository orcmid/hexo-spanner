    This file is maintained under folder nfoCentrale on the auhor's PC.  The
    latest version is automatically included when the static blog pages
    generated by Hexo to nfoCentrale/spanner/public/about/ are uploaded to
    the blog's location at http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/hexo-about/.
    
    The use of hexo-about/ instead of simply about/ is a precaution in the
    event that a different blog generation is used in the future, leaving this
    as the preserved predecessor.

TODO:
 
 * Add explanation of this supporting material to the index.html about page.
 
 * Add explanation of LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt to the about page also. 
 
 * Emphasize that the Wingnut version is intended to require further local
   specialization for the restoration of Numbering Peano, nfoCentrale Status,
   and other formerly-Blogger blogs.
   
 * Adjust hexo-about/hexo-spanner/ and hexo-about/hexo-landscape/ to reflect
   the renaming of about/ to hexo-about/.
