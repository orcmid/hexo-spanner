## *This post has no title whatsoever* ##

This is the ninth in a series of Spanner Wingnut confirmation tests using the Hexo Unit Tests for Themes.  This test *post has no title*.  The test is to confirm that the post remains accessible.

This test is derived from the [hexo-theme-unit-test](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-unit-test) `no-title.md` Post of 2013-12-25.

The challenge is to see how the post remains accessible, how it appears in archives and the Recent Post lists, and how it is separated from others on the index page.

## Observations ##

 * The persistent post has its slug specified as "`untitled`" and is located at [wingnut/2017/12/09/untitled](http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/2017/12/09/untitled/).  In archives and archive-like indexes, there is no title, only a post date.  
 
 * The persistent post can be located from other locations and index entries by the post date.
 
 * It becomes interesting to know what happens if two no-title posts are produced on the same date.
