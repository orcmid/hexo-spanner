Welcome to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)! This is the very first post, provided by Hexo to demonstrate correct installation of an authoring folder and related software. This page may update automatically from time to time as changes in style and other customizations are introduced.  It remains here as the first Hexo-produced wingnut post despite the occasional update.  

This preface is added to explain the unique status of this page.  Experiments with this Spanner Wingnut blog confirm features and styling before introducing them to other blogs in the ***[nfoCentrale](http://nfocentrale.com)*** family.  

For more information about these activities, see [About](/BlunderDome/wingnut/hexo-about/).
