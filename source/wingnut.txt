    This file is maintained at nfoCentrale/spanner/source/wingnut.txt on the
    author's PC.  The latest version is automatically included when the static
    blog pages generated by Hexo to nfoCentrale/spanner/public/ are uploaded
    to the blog's location on the orcmid.com hosted site.
    
    See <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/index.htm> for more on the
    construction structure that the web-published material is spliced into.  
    Also see <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/hexo-about/> for more 
    information.
    
    NOTE: During provisional development, wingnut/default.htm had precedence
    and the blog served at <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut> was that
    produced by Movable Type and now dormant.
       URL <http://orcmid.com/BlunderDome/wingnut/index.html> provides access
    to the experimental uploads as part of Hexo operation, althugh that page
    is now automatically duplicated at default.htm.
       In the (unlikely?) event that there is yet-another migration to a
    different blog-generation mechanism, we'll need a way to push this one
    down to legacy as well.  Because the pages are static, there should be
    a way.

TODO:

 * Upgrade to fancyBox 3 seems appropriate for responsive presentations and
   touch-enabled access.  Something to look into.
   
 * Adjust the site wingnut/index.htm Construction Structure page to account
   for the introduction of the Hexo-generated blog and these additional
   narrative pages.  Also reflect deleted material.
